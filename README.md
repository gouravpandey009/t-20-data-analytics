# 🏏 T-20 Cricket Data Analytics Project

Welcome to the **T-20 Cricket World Cup Data Analytics** project! This project leverages the power of **Power BI**, **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Jupyter Notebook** to explore and visualize exciting insights from T-20 World Cup matches! 🌍✨

## 🚀 Project Overview
The aim of this project is to provide comprehensive data analysis on matches played during the T-20 Cricket World Cup. With the help of interactive dashboards in **Power BI**, users can:
- 📊 **Analyze** the performance of teams and players.
- 🏆 **Build** their best playing XI from a pool of World Cup players.
- 🔍 **Explore** various player statistics and compare individual performances.
  
The **Power BI Dashboard** allows seamless interaction for discovering insights at a glance! You can download the `.pbix` file from the repository and explore the data locally in Power BI Desktop.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack & Tools**
This project was built using the following technologies:
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboard creation.
- **Python** and **Pandas** for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Web Scraping** using Python to collect data from ESPN Cricinfo.
- **Power Query** for data transformation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for building data models and calculations.

## 🌟 **Key Steps of the Project**
Here's a breakdown of the steps involved in making this project a success:

### 1. 📝 **Requirement Scoping**
   Understanding the project goals and defining the key metrics to analyze the matches and player performances.

### 2. 🌐 **Data Collection**
   Data was collected using **web scraping** techniques from the ESPN Cricinfo website, gathering detailed stats on matches, players, and performances.

### 3. 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   Using **Pandas** in **Jupyter Notebook**, the raw data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistency and accuracy in analysis.

### 4. 🪄 **Data Transformation**
   Data was transformed in **Power Query** to prepare it for visual representation and modeling in Power BI.

### 5. ⚒️ **Data Modelling**
   Using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** in Power BI, the data was modeled to create relationships between different datasets and generate meaningful insights.

### 6. 📊 **Dashboard Creation**
   The final step involved building a sleek and interactive dashboard in **Power BI** to visualize the data, including:
   - 🚀 **Power Hitters & Openers**
   - 🎯 **Anchors**
   - 🔥 **Finishers**
   - 🛡️ **All-Rounders**
   - ⚡ **Fast Bowlers**
   - 🏏 **Pick Your Final 11**

## 📸 ** In Dashboard you can find such features**
   Here are a few glimpses of the dashboard that help users make informed decisions:
   - **Power Hitters & Openers** 🏏
   - **Hover Effect** 🔍
   - **Individual Stats** 🎯
   - **All-Rounders & Finishers** 🛡️
   - **Pick Your Final 11** ✨

## 🌈 **Why This Project Stands Out**
- 📈 **Data-Driven Insights**: The project combines multiple data analytics techniques to derive meaningful insights from real-world cricket data.
- 🧠 **Interactive Analysis**: The Power BI dashboard allows users to interact with data and derive insights in real-time.
- 🏅 **Comprehensive Player Analysis**: The dashboard provides a detailed breakdown of individual and team performance, making it easier to pick the best team.
- 🔗 **Seamless Integration**: The project integrates **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Power BI**, making it a full-stack data analytics solution.
